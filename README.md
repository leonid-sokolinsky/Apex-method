# Apex-method
Parallel implementation of the apex-method in C++ using the BSF-skeleton with a workflow support

This repository contains source codes of a parallel implementation of the novel apex-method for solving large-scale linear programming problems on computing clusters. The solution is built in C++ using the BSF-skeleton with a workflow support. The source codes of the BSF-skeleton with a user manual are available at https://github.com/leonid-sokolinsky/BSF-skeleton.

A description of the apex-method is available in the paper:

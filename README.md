# Apex-method
Parallel implementation of the apex-method in C++ using the BSF-skeleton with a workflow support

This repository contains source codes of a parallel implementation of the novel apex-method for solving large-scale linear programming problems on computing clusters. The solution is built using the BSF-skeleton in C++.
